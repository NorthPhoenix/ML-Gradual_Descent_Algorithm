Submission includes:
    - main.py
    - main.ipynb

Part 1 & 2 are written together in the same file.
Both files contain the same code. One is a pure python file, the other is a Jupyter notebook (which I find easier to run).
SKLearn SGDRegressor was used for the second part of the assignment.

            |  How to run:  |
            #################

Option 1 - Run main.ipynb file in Google Colab
    1. Go to Google Colab.
    2. Import main.ipynb into an empty notebook.
    3. Run all cells.
    4. Output and graphs are inline with code.



Option 2 - Run main.ipynb file with VSCode
    1. Install Python ( Tested on Python 3.11.2 )
    
    2. Install required libraries: 
    numpy:
        pip install numpy
    pandas:
        pip install pandas
    matplotlib:
        python -m pip install -U pip
        python -m pip install -U matplotlib
    sklearn:
        pip install -U scikit-learn

    3. Install VSCode.

    4. Install the official Python extension for VSCode.

    5. Open main.ipynb with VSCode.

    6. Run all cells.



Option 3 - Run main.py file in a command line
    1. Install Python ( Tested on Python 3.11.2 )
    
    2. Install required libraries: 
    numpy:
        pip install numpy
    pandas:
        pip install pandas
    matplotlib:
        python -m pip install -U pip
        python -m pip install -U matplotlib
    sklearn:
        pip install -U scikit-learn

    3. Navigate to the folder with main.py file in the terminal

    4. Run the following command ("python" must be associated with the right version)
        python main.py

    5. You will see text output in the console and you will get a graph popup. Close a graph window to see the next graph (3 total graphs).
